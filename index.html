<h5> &lt;Unleashing the Power of the Mind&gt; </h5>
<blockquote> Pablo Picasso once said something along the lines of&hellip;
&ldquo;Know the rules like a Pro, so that you can break them like an Artist&rdquo;</blockquote>
<p>
	 Being a Physicist entails identifying a system&apos;s finite energy values and their respective potential and momentous flows so well that one can manipulate them with impeccable precision.  
	Deconstructing and constructing the flows of Energy in such a way that they flow freely in a desirable manner. Following contours that enable optimum transfers of energy, resonating with the local environment. 
	The practice of modern Engineering is about knowing the laws of Nature so well, that you can piece them together with applicable aesthetic finesse to efficiently and effectively solve current problems at hand.

<ol>
	<li> A skilled Physicist can deconstruct Nature </li>
	<li> A skilled Engineer can construct Tangible Solutions </li>
</ol>
<p> Together these can <em>harmonize</em>, where one is neither greater than the other.  A superposition of such nature that allows for the production of artistic works of applicable scientific solutions. The canvas being higher dimensional abstract vector spaces.  The medium consisting of numerical techniques: Finite-Differential analysis, Linear Algebra, and Calculus of Variations. The paintbrush a modern Central Processing Unit.
  This is the Heart of RaboMetrics <em>producing works of numerical art </em> through: system modeling, data acquisition, and precise decision-making algorithms. Enabling the user to optimize system resources and desired parameter output.  RaboMetrics is a thought project that seeks to redefine the perception of the use of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics through techniques of system modeling interpretations and scientific computing software application implementations.
